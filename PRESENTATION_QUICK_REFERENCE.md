## üé§ Demo Script (8 minutes)

### Opening (30s)

"FinFlow AI is an agentic financial platform with specialized AI agents. Let me show you how it works..."

### Demo 1: Transaction Analysis (2m)

**What to show:**

- Incoming transaction from Plaid
- WebSocket events appearing in real-time
- Each agent completing with results
- Final insight generated

**What to say:**
"This is a $25 transaction at Starbucks. Our system analyzes it through multiple agents in real-time. You can see:

- Categorization: Dining/Restaurants (95% confidence)
- Fraud analysis: Low risk
- Budget check: Within limits
- Cashflow impact: Minimal

All of this happens automatically with WebSocket streaming so the UI updates live."

---

### Demo 2: Chat Agent (2m)

**What to show:**

- Ask "Where is my money going?"
- Show Sankey diagram generating
- Show comprehensive interpretation

**What to say:**
"Our chat agent automatically decided this needs visualization. It queried your spending data, generated a Sankey diagram showing money flow, and then provided a comprehensive interpretation with:

- What it shows (spending breakdown)
- Key insights (Dining is 35%)
- Education (typical benchmark is 25%)
- Action steps (specific recommendations)

All without asking permission - it just knows when visualization helps."

---

### Demo 3: Decision Agent (3m)

**What to show:**

- Start decision analysis
- Show 7-agent pipeline executing
- Show final recommendation with reasoning

**What to say:**
"For major financial decisions like leasing vs financing a car, we run a comprehensive 7-agent analysis:

1. **Data Fusion** - Loads your financial history
2. **TCO Calculator** - Calculates total cost (lease: $42.5k, finance: $45.2k)
3. **Risk Agent** - Your runway drops from 120 to 90 days
4. **Credit Agent** - DTI increases to 35%
5. **Opportunity Cost** - You could invest that $3000 instead
6. **Behavioral Coach** - Recommends adjusting grocery budget
7. **Synthesis** - Final verdict: Finance recommended with 67% confidence

Here's the full comparison matrix, risks, and action items."

## ‚ùì Common Q&A

**Q: How do you ensure accuracy?**
A: A2A verification - agents verify each other's work. Plus statistical validation for fraud/categorization.

**Q: What about privacy?**
A: User-scoped tools with automatic authentication - no data leakage possible. Every tool receives user_id, LLM can't override.

**Q: How fast is it?**
A: Parallel processing where possible, cached summaries (6-hour freshness), optimized pipelines. Transaction analysis: ~3-5 seconds. Decisions: ~30-60 seconds.

**Q: Why multiple agents vs one LLM?**
A: Specialization improves accuracy. Each agent is best at its task. Better maintainability, debugging, and extensibility.

**Q: How do you handle errors?**
A: Graceful degradation, WebSocket error events, fallback mechanisms. User always gets a response.

**Q: How does this scale?**
A: Stateless agents, session-based state, efficient caching, WebSocket connection pooling, parallel processing.

**Q: What's the A2A protocol?**
A: Agent-to-Agent protocol - agents verify each other's work. Categorization agent sends results to verification agent for consensus.

**Q: What data do you store?**
A: Transactions, budgets, insights, alerts, decision analyses. All user-specific with automatic scoping.

**Q: How do you train?**
A: We don't train models - we orchestrate existing models (Gemini). Users can provide feedback for improvement.

**Q: What's the business model?**
A: [Fill in based on your plans - SaaS, freemium, etc.]
