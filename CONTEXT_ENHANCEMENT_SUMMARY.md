# Context Enhancement Summary

## Changes Made

### Problem

The decision analysis UI was showing stress test results with minimal context - just "Income Drop 10%" or "Pass/Fail" without explaining WHY it passed or failed.

### Solution

Enhanced both the **backend** (synthesis agent) and **frontend** (RiskAssessment component) to display detailed impact data and context.

---

## Backend Changes

### File: `agents/decision_agent/subagents/synthesis_agent/agent.py`

**What was changed:**

- Previously only passed `passes` and `message` fields to stress_tests
- Now also passes complete `impact` data object with detailed metrics

**Specific change:**

```python
# Before:
stress_tests["income_drop_10"] = {
    "passes": can_sustain,
    "message": scenario.get("impact", {}).get("message", "")
}

# After:
stress_tests["income_drop_10"] = {
    "passes": can_sustain,
    "message": verdict_message,
    "impact": impact_data  # ← Now includes all impact metrics
}
```

**Impact data now includes:**

- For Income Drop scenarios: `new_monthly_income`, `new_monthly_expenses`, `new_monthly_margin`, `emergency_fund_depletion_months`
- For Expense Spike scenarios: `new_monthly_expenses`, `new_monthly_margin`
- For Emergency Expense scenarios: `remaining_emergency_fund`, `months_covered`

---

## Frontend Changes

### File: `frontend/src/app/(pages)/dashboard/decisions/components/RiskAssessment.tsx`

**What was changed:**

1. **Updated TypeScript interface** to include impact data structure
2. **Enhanced stress test rendering** to display detailed context based on test type

**Before:**

```
Income Drop 10%
Manageable - You'd still have $500/month positive margin
[PASS]
```

**After:**

```
Income Drop 10%
Manageable - You'd still have $500/month positive margin

New Income: $3,150/mo
New Expenses: $2,800/mo
Monthly Margin: $350/mo
[PASS]
```

**New features:**

- Shows actual new income amount after 10% drop
- Shows new expenses with the decision factored in
- Shows monthly margin (positive or negative)
- Shows emergency fund depletion timeline if applicable
- Displays remaining emergency fund after emergency expense
- Shows months of coverage remaining

## Impact on User Experience

### Before

Users saw:

- ✅ "Income Drop 10% - PASS"
- ❌ "Expense Spike - FAIL"

### After

Users see:

**Income Drop 10%:**

- ✅ PASS
- **New Income:** $3,150/mo
- **New Expenses:** $2,800/mo
- **Monthly Margin:** $350/mo (positive margin)

**Expense Spike:**

- ❌ FAIL
- **Spiked Expenses:** $3,000/mo
- **Monthly Margin:** -$150/mo (burning through savings)
- ⚠️ Would need budget rebalancing

**Emergency Expense:**

- ✅ PASS
- **Remaining Fund:** $8,500
- **Months Covered:** 4.2 months
- Manageable - Emergency fund remains adequate

---

## Benefits

1. **More Educative**: Users understand WHY something passes or fails
2. **Actionable**: Shows exactly what numbers changed
3. **Transparent**: Full visibility into the financial impact
4. **Confidence Building**: Clear metrics increase trust in the analysis
5. **Decision Support**: Helps users make informed choices

## Testing

To verify the changes work:

1. Run a decision analysis (e.g., car lease vs finance)
2. Navigate to the analysis results page
3. Scroll to "Risk Assessment" section
4. Expand "Stress Test Scenarios"
5. Verify detailed metrics are displayed for each test

**Expected behavior:**

- Income drop tests show new income, expenses, and margin
- Expense spike tests show spiked expenses and margin
- Emergency expense tests show remaining fund and months covered
- All metrics are formatted with proper currency/numbers

---

## Files Modified

1. `agents/decision_agent/subagents/synthesis_agent/agent.py`

   - Updated to pass `impact` data in stress_tests
   - Line ~330-356

2. `frontend/src/app/(pages)/dashboard/decisions/components/RiskAssessment.tsx`
   - Updated TypeScript interface
   - Enhanced rendering with context details
   - Lines ~254-407

---

## Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- If impact data is missing, UI gracefully shows just the message
- Color coding: Green for pass with positive metrics, red for fail with negative metrics
- Formatting uses proper number localization (toLocaleString())
